The linens and towels are clean and fresh. You feel at home here. The architectural design of the space feels open and welcoming and gives you this sense of instant-calm, upon entering. You just want to throw your shoes off and head to the balcony for a nice glass of wine and a sundown-view. Love this place!`,

				quote: `Our family was fortunate to reunite this past weekend at Hilltop 365. First time together in many years. This home was perfect for our four couples. Perfect in many ways - ample size, ideal amenities, much-needed serenity, luxurious comfort, and perfect location. It's close enough to the quaint downtown Paso Robles district to walk there and back, even though the house is at elevation. I'm close to 80 years old and I walked into town and back. Working with the owner was a breeze - quick response every time. The kitchen is fully equipped, the beds were just perfect, and the views are simply breathtaking. We are all so glad we chose this home and would do so again.`,

Sleeps 10 easily and has amazing views from the top balcony and two other balconies privately situated off of the bedrooms. All the amenities provided make it the perfect getaway for a family or friend group. 5 stars all the way.`,

I have been paralyzed with arranging my furniture from multiple rooms to an open floorplan.  I felt everything was very disjointed. So, I hired Debra to help me rearrange my furniture and decor as well as select an accent wall paint color to pull everything together. She arrived promptly with uddles of energy.  She spent about an hour rearranging my furniture and decor.  She ended her visit by recommending the perfect paint color as well as suggestions about final touches needed to pull the entire space together. I am extremely impressed with her level of expertise.  She has beautiful taste but understands the importance of maintaining the integrity of items that hold priceless memories.  Thank you Debra for all you did to make my house a home!`,
